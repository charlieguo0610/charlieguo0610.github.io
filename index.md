## About Me

<!-- I'm a <a href="https://med.nyu.edu/departments-institutes/population-health/divisions-sections-centers/biostatistics/" target="_blank"> Statistics</a> Ph.D. candidate at <a href="https://www.nyu.edu/" target="_blank"> New York University</a>, -->
I'm currently a fourth-year undergraduate student in Computer Science at <a href="https://www.utoronto.ca/" target="_blank"> University of Toronto</a>. I'm interested in computer vision and I have garnered a wealth of research experience across both academic and industry settings.

My journey includes a role as a computer vision engineer intern at the CV lab, <a href="https://corporate.jd.com/" target="_blank"> JD AI Research </a> in 2021, where I developed a patented Self-Attention Defect Detection method and was recognized as a Star Intern by <a href="https://taomei.me/" target="_blank"> Dr. Tao Mei </a>, Vice President of JD.com. In 2023, I contributed to the Dynamic Graphics Project (DGP) Lab at the University of Toronto, focusing on Denoising Diffusion Models to generate neural 3D representations, under the guidance of Prof. <a href="https://davidlindell.com/" target="_blank"> David Lindell</a>. Now, I have been leading several projects on 3D scene editing and inpaintings as a computer vision research intern at Noah's Ark Lab, <a href="https://www.huawei.com/ca/" target="_blank"> Huawei Technologies Canada</a>.

Outside of academia, I'm passionately engaged in the game of golf, since each game is a perfect blend of mental challenge and physical activity that complements my rigorous academic pursuits. During the winter months, I revel in the thrill of snowboarding, finding it a relaxing way to glide down snowy slopes.



## Research Interests
- **3D Representations:** Neural Radiance Field (NeRF), 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
- **Applications in AIGC:** Text to 3D Generation and Editing using Diffusion Models
