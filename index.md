## About Me

I'm currently a fourth-year undergraduate student in Computer Science at <a href="https://www.utoronto.ca/" target="_blank">University of Toronto</a>, where I focus on computer vision and generative artificial intelligence (GenAI).

I joined the Dynamic Graphics Project (DGP) Lab to lead a research project on controllable human image personalization, advised by Prof. <a href="https://davidlindell.com/" target="_blank">David Lindell</a> and <a href="https://sherwinbahmani.github.io/" target="_blank">Sherwin Bahmani</a>. I also conducted research on LLMs for healthcare at the Vector Institute, under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rahulgk/index.html" target="_blank">Rahul G. Krishnan</a> and <a href="https://jerryji007.github.io/" target="_blank">Jerry Ji</a>. Earlier in my undergrad studies, I worked with Prof. David Lindell as the first collaboration on generative modeling for neural 3D representations.

In industry, I gained experience as a computer vision engineer intern at the CV Lab, <a href="https://corporate.jd.com/" target="_blank">JD.com</a>, focusing on 2D vision tasks, where I received the Star Intern award from the Vice President of JD.com, Dr. <a href="https://taomei.me/" target="_blank">Tao Mei</a>. Following this, I completed a one-year co-op at Noah's Ark Lab, <a href="https://www.huawei.com/ca/" target="_blank">Huawei Canada</a>, under Prof. <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/xinxinzuohome/home" target="_blank">Xinxin Zuo</a> and Dr. <a href="https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=Asz24wcAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Juwei Lu</a>, exploring the integration of 2D foundation models into 3D objects and scenes.

Outside of academia, I am passionate about golf, appreciating its blend of mental challenge and physical precision as a counterbalance to my academic endeavors. During the winter months, I find snowboarding a refreshing and exhilarating way to unwind while navigating snowy slopes.
