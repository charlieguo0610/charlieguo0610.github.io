## About Me

I'm a MSR student in the <a href="https://www.ri.cmu.edu/" target="_blank">Robotics Institute</a> at <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/" target="_blank">Carnegie Mellon University</a>. I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the <a href="https://www.utoronto.ca/" target="_blank">University of Toronto</a>, where I focused on computer vision and generative artificial intelligence (GenAI).

Previously, I had the opportunity to work with Prof. <a href="https://davidlindell.com/" target="_blank">David Lindell</a> on controllable image personalization at the DGP Lab, Prof. <a href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rahulgk/index.html" target="_blank">Rahul G. Krishnan</a> on LLMs for healthcare at the Vector Institute.

In industry, I spent one year as a computer vision researcher at Noah's Ark Lab, Huawei Canada, working with Dr. <a href="https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=Asz24wcAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Juwei Lu</a> on integrating 2D foundation models with 3D representations. Prior to that, I interned at JD.com's CV Lab under Dr. <a href="https://taomei.me/" target="_blank">Tao Mei</a>, where I was recognized with the Star Intern award.

Outside of academia, I am passionate about golf and tennis. During the winter months, I find snowboarding a refreshing and exhilarating way to unwind while navigating snowy slopes.
