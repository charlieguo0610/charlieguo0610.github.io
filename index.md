## About Me

<!-- I'm a <a href="https://med.nyu.edu/departments-institutes/population-health/divisions-sections-centers/biostatistics/" target="_blank"> Statistics</a> Ph.D. candidate at <a href="https://www.nyu.edu/" target="_blank"> New York University</a>, -->
I'm currently a fourth-year undergraduate student in Computer Science at <a href="https://www.utoronto.ca/" target="_blank"> University of Toronto</a>. I'm interested in computer vision and I have garnered a wealth of research experience across both academic and industry settings.

My journey includes a role as a computer vision engineer intern at the CV lab, <a href="https://corporate.jd.com/" target="_blank"> JD AI Research </a> in 2021, where I developed a novel Self-Attention Defect Detection method, securing patent rights as the lead author and earning recognition as a Star Intern from <a href="https://taomei.me/" target="_blank"> Dr. Tao Mei </a>, Vice President of JD.com. 

In 2022, I shifted focus towards applications of computer vision, deploying trained models on Huawei Atlas 500 AI Edge Station. Using ONNX Runtime and OM models, I was deeply involved optimizing streaming capabilities for <a href="https://www.cnpc.com.cn/en/" target="_blank">PetroChina Oilfield's </a> monitoring platforms at an impressive rate of 30 FPS. 

In 2023, I contributed to the Dynamic Graphics Project (DGP) Lab at the University of Toronto, focusing on the design and implementation of Denoising Diffusion Models to generate neural 3D representations, under the guidance of Prof. <a href="https://davidlindell.com/" target="_blank"> David Lindell</a>. 

Now, I have been leading several projects on 3D scene editing and inpaintings as a computer vision research intern at Noah's Ark Lab, <a href="https://www.huawei.com/ca/" target="_blank"> Huawei Technologies Canada</a>.

Outside of academia, I'm passionately engaged in the game of golf, since each game is a perfect blend of mental challenge and physical activity that complements my rigorous academic pursuits. During the winter months, I revel in the thrill of snowboarding, finding it a relaxing way to glide down snowy slopes.
